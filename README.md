# Angular GUI Crawler

Easely crawl rather scrape webpages with a GUI based on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) + [Pug (formaly Jade)](https://pugjs.org/) on the front and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) + [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) + [Node](https://nodejs.org) on the back.

Watch your Crawler in realtime, start and pause it like you want. Configure for what it should look for and store your scraped data reliable in a local database. Collect statistics about older crawls and compare them.
## How to use it
